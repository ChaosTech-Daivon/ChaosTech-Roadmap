# ChaosTech Systems Roadmap

**Company:** ChaosTech Defense LLC  
**Founder:** Daivon M. Brown  
**Mission:** To disrupt the way war is fought through chaos-based technology.

---

### Overview

This repository documents the development roadmap for ChaosTech’s flagship technologies, including:

- **Neuro Swarm Disruptor (NSD)**
- **FIREFLY Protocol**
- **Next-Gen Tactical Signal Devices**
- **DarkTech R&D Streams**

ChaosTech was built for edge conditions, unpredictable conflict zones, and the people who are tired of playing defense. This roadmap reflects our drive to stay dangerous, lean, and ahead of the curve.

### Core Projects

#### **1. Neuro Swarm Disruptor (NSD)**
> A solar-powered, stealth-enclosed, chaos-based device to neutralize drone swarms.

- Q2 2025: Physical spec finalization
- Q3 2025: Early hardware prototype
- Q4 2025: Field testing with tactical advisors

#### **2. FIREFLY Protocol**
> Signal chaos generator designed to hijack, confuse, and overwhelm RF-based autonomy.

- Q2 2025: Pseudocode + RF entropy model
- Q3 2025: Simulated chaos testing (Python/C)
- Q4 2025: Embedded integration with NSD firmware

### Long-Term Vision

ChaosTech aims to lead a new era of warfare systems:  
- Borderless. Buttonless. Predictably unpredictable.  
- Designed for elite operators, ghost teams, and AI-driven fieldwork.

We are not building just another defense device — we’re architecting digital dominance from the noise up.
